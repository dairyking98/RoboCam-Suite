## Implementation Strategy

### Parallel Work Streams

Some phases can be worked on in parallel:

1. **Stream A**: Documentation & Setup (Phase 1) ✅
2. **Stream B**: Motion Configuration (Phase 4) - Can start immediately
3. **Stream C**: Code Quality (Phase 5) - Should start early
4. **Stream D**: GUI & FPS (Phase 2) + 4-Corner (Phase 3) - Sequential

### Recommended Order

1. **Immediate**: Complete Phase 1, start Phase 5 (code quality)
2. **Next**: Phase 4 (motion config) - independent, high value
3. **Then**: Phase 2 (GUI/FPS) - critical for performance
4. **Followed by**: Phase 3 (4-corner) - major workflow improvement
5. **Finally**: Phases 6, 7, 8 - polish and organization

### Milestones

- **Milestone 1**: Basic documentation and setup complete ✅
- **Milestone 2**: Motion configuration system working
- **Milestone 3**: GUI consistent and FPS optimized
- **Milestone 4**: 4-corner calibration functional
- **Milestone 5**: Code quality improvements complete
- **Milestone 6**: All high-priority features implemented

## Notes

- Phases are not strictly sequential - some work can be done in parallel
- User feedback may change priorities
- Some tasks may be combined for efficiency
- Testing should be done incrementally, not just at the end
- Documentation should be updated as features are added
