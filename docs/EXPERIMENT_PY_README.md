# experiment.py - Automated Well-Plate Experiment Execution

## Overview

`experiment.py` is a GUI-based application for automating well-plate experiments with synchronized camera capture and laser stimulation. It provides a comprehensive interface for configuring and executing multi-well experiments for FluorCam, StentorCam, and other automated microscopy experiments under the RoboCam umbrella, with precise timing control, motion profiles, and data export capabilities.

## Functionality

### Core Purpose

The application automates the execution of well-plate experiments by:

1. **Automated Movement**: Moves a camera-equipped positioning stage to predefined well coordinates
2. **Synchronized Capture**: Records video or captures still images at each well position
3. **Laser Control**: Provides precise timing sequences for laser stimulation (OFF-ON-OFF pattern)
4. **Data Export**: Generates CSV files with well coordinates and metadata
5. **Configuration Management**: Saves and loads experiment configurations for reproducibility

### Main Workflow

1. **Configuration**: User sets up well positions (X, Y coordinates), labels, timing sequences, camera settings, and motion parameters
2. **Sequence Generation**: Application builds a well sequence based on selected pattern (snake or raster)
3. **Execution**: For each well:
   - Moves to well position with configured motion profile
   - Starts video/still capture
   - Executes laser timing sequence (OFF → ON → OFF)
   - Stops recording and saves file with formatted name
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time status updates, timers, and progress tracking

## Features

### 1. Calibration-Based Well Selection

- **Calibration Loading**: Load saved 4-corner calibrations from `calibrations/`
- **Well Selection Window**: Separate window for selecting wells via checkboxes
  - Opens via "Select Cells" button (enabled when calibration is loaded)
  - Button is disabled when selection window is open
  - Scrollable grid ensures all wells are visible
  - All wells are checked by default
  - **Check All / Uncheck All Buttons**: Quick selection controls in the window
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts** (Smart Fill/Unfill Logic):
    - **Shift+Click**: Smart fill/unfill all wells in the same row
      - If clicked checkbox is checked and row is all checked: unfills (unchecks all) in row
      - If clicked checkbox is checked and row is not all checked: fills (checks all) in row
      - If clicked checkbox is unchecked and row is all unchecked: fills (checks all) in row
      - If clicked checkbox is unchecked and row has some checked: unfills (unchecks all) in row
    - **Ctrl+Click**: Smart fill/unfill all wells in the same column
      - If clicked checkbox is checked and column is all checked: unfills (unchecks all) in column
      - If clicked checkbox is checked and column is not all checked: fills (checks all) in column
      - If clicked checkbox is unchecked and column is all unchecked: fills (checks all) in column
      - If clicked checkbox is unchecked and column has some checked: unfills (unchecks all) in column
  - **GUI Instructions**: Helpful instructions displayed next to the grid explaining all interaction methods
- **Auto-Generated Labels**: Wells labeled automatically (A1, A2, ..., B1, B2, etc.)
- **Interpolated Positions**: All well positions calculated from 4-corner calibration
- **Z Value**: Automatically set from calibration interpolation (no manual entry)
- **Pattern Selection**: Choose between "snake →↙" (alternating row direction/zig-zag) or "raster →↓" (consistent direction/rectilinear, default)
- **Calibration Required**: Experiment cannot start without a loaded calibration
- **No Manual Entry**: Manual coordinate entry has been removed - calibration is required

### 2. GPIO Action Phases

- **Adjustable Action List**: Configure custom GPIO action sequences with GUI-friendly controls
  - **Default Phase**: Always starts with one GPIO OFF phase (default: 30 seconds)
  - **Add Actions**: Click "Add Action" button to add additional phases
  - **Action Types**: Each phase can be set to "GPIO ON" or "GPIO OFF"
  - **Time Entry**: Each phase has its own time entry field (in seconds)

  - `precise.json`: Optimized for precision
- **Preliminary Settings**: Separate feedrate and acceleration for homing/initial movements
- **Between-Wells Settings**: Separate feedrate and acceleration for well-to-well movements
- **Automatic Application**: Motion settings are automatically applied based on movement phase

### 5. File Management

- **Experiment Name**: Name identifier for the experiment (default: "exp")
  - Used in filename generation to identify the experiment
  - Replaces the `{exp}` placeholder in the filename format
- **Filename Format**: Fixed format `{date}_{time}_{experiment_name}_{y}{x}.{ext}`
  - `{date}`: Date (YYYYMMDD format, e.g., "20241215")
  - `{time}`: Timestamp (HHMMSS format, e.g., "143022")
  - `{experiment_name}`: Experiment name from the "Experiment Name" field
  - `{y}`: Row letter (e.g., "A", "B", "C")
  - `{x}`: Column number (e.g., "1", "2", "3")
  - `{ext}`: File extension based on export type (`.h264`, `.mjpeg`, `.jpeg`)
  - Example: `20241215_143022_exp_B2.h264`
- **Save Folder**: Output files are saved to `outputs/YYYYMMDD_{experiment_name}/` (not configurable via GUI)
  - The application automatically creates the directory if it doesn't exist
  - Each experiment run gets its own subfolder with date prefix in `outputs/`
  - Format: `outputs/YYYYMMDD_{experiment_name}/` where YYYYMMDD is the date when experiment starts
  - Provides detailed error messages if directory creation fails
  - Verifies write permissions before starting experiments
- **CSV Export**: Automatic generation of CSV file with format `{date}_{time}_{exp}_points.csv` containing well coordinates in `outputs/YYYYMMDD_{experiment_name}/`
- **Experiment Settings Export**: Save complete experiment configuration to JSON with format `{date}_{time}_{exp}_profile.json` directly to `experiments/` folder (no file dialog)
- **Experiment Settings Load**: Load settings from dropdown (similar to calibration dropdown) - selects from `experiments/` folder
- **Experiment Settings Import**: Load saved configurations with calibration validation

### 6. Configuration Persistence

- **Default Values**: Window initializes with default settings (1920x1080, 30 FPS, H264, etc.)
- **Experiment Settings Export**: Export complete configuration including calibration reference
- **Experiment Settings Import**: Load saved configurations with automatic calibration validation
- **No Auto-Save**: Settings are not automatically saved - use export/import for persistence

### 7. Real-Time Monitoring

  - Shows detailed progress: "Moving to well X at (Y, Z)", "Recording - OFF for Xs", etc.
  - Displays errors and completion messages
- **Recording Indicator**: Flashing button that indicates when video recording is active
  - Gray when idle
  - Red/dark red flashing during recording
- **Timers**:
  - **Duration**: Total estimated experiment time
  - **Elapsed**: Time since experiment start
  - **Remaining**: Estimated time to completion
- **Live Preview**: Example filename preview as settings change

## Logic Behind the Implementation

### Architecture

The application follows an object-oriented design with a main `ExperimentWindow` class that manages:

- **GUI Components**: Tkinter-based interface with organized sections
- **Hardware Control**: Integration with `RoboCam` (printer control) and `Laser` (GPIO control)
- **Camera Management**: Picamera2 instance for video/still capture
- **Threading**: Separate execution thread to prevent GUI blocking

### Sequence Generation Logic

When using calibration:
```python
# Get selected wells from checkboxes
selected_wells = [label for label, var in well_checkboxes.items() if var.get()]

# Map labels to interpolated positions
label_to_pos = {label: pos for label, pos in zip(labels, interpolated_positions)}

# Build sequence from selected wells
for label in selected_wells:
    pos = label_to_pos[label]
    # Extract row/column for pattern sorting
    row_num = ord(label[0]) - ord('A')
    col_num = int(label[1:]) - 1
    selected_positions.append((pos[0], pos[1], pos[2], label, row_num, col_num))

# Sort by pattern
pattern = pattern_var.get()
# Extract pattern name (handles both "snake"/"raster" and "snake →↙"/"raster →↓" formats)
if pattern.startswith("snake"):
    pattern = "snake"
elif pattern.startswith("raster"):
    pattern = "raster"

if pattern == "snake":
    # Snake: alternate row direction (zig-zag pattern)
    selected_positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[4], x[5] if x[4] % 2 == 0 else -x[5]))
else:  # raster (default)
    # Raster: consistent direction (rectilinear pattern)
    selected_positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[4], x[5]))
```

**Note**: Manual coordinate entry has been removed. All well positions must come from calibration files.

### Motion Control Logic

1. **Preliminary Phase** (before homing):
   - Loads preliminary feedrate and acceleration from motion config
   - Applies acceleration via `M204` G-code command
   - Executes homing sequence

2. **Between-Wells Phase** (well movements):
   - Switches to between-wells feedrate and acceleration
   - Applies acceleration settings
   - Uses between-wells feedrate from motion configuration
   - Moves to each well position with `move_absolute()`

### Camera Configuration Logic

The application uses separate camera configurations for different phases:

1. **Preview Configuration** (if needed):
   - Lower resolution (640x480) for GUI display
   - Optimized for real-time preview

2. **Recording Configuration**:
   - Full resolution as specified by user
   - Frame rate control via `FrameRate` parameter
   - Optimized buffer settings (`buffer_count=2`) for maximum FPS
   - Preview disabled during recording to maximize performance

### Timing Sequence Logic

For each well (video modes only):

```python
start_recording()
for action, phase_time in action_phases:
    state = 1 if action == "GPIO ON" else 0
    laser.switch(state)
    wait(phase_time seconds)
stop_recording()
```

The system iterates through all configured action phases in order, switching the GPIO state and waiting for the specified duration for each phase. This allows for fully customizable sequences beyond the traditional OFF-ON-OFF pattern.

**Example Sequences**:
- **Traditional**: OFF (30s) → ON (20s) → OFF (10s)
- **Extended**: OFF (30s) → ON (20s) → OFF (10s) → ON (5s) → OFF (15s)
- **Simple**: OFF (30s) only
- **Multiple Pulses**: OFF (10s) → ON (5s) → OFF (5s) → ON (5s) → OFF (10s)

For JPEG mode:
- Single capture at well position (no timing sequence)

### Error Handling

- **Input Validation**: Type checking and range validation for all user inputs
- **Hardware Errors**: Try-except blocks around all hardware operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation when non-critical errors occur
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages displayed in status label

### Threading Model

- **Main Thread**: GUI event loop (tkinter)
- **Execution Thread**: Experiment run loop (daemon thread)
  - Prevents GUI freezing during long operations
  - Allows pause/stop control from GUI
  - Automatic cleanup on application exit

### Action Phase Validation

Action phases are validated before experiment execution:
- At least one phase must be configured
- All phases must have valid time values (non-negative numbers)
- Time values are parsed as floats (supports decimals)
- Invalid phases are skipped during execution (with warning)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied: Cannot create directory"**
   - **Symptom**: Error message when starting experiment or saving CSV
   - **Cause**: Insufficient permissions to create `outputs/` directory or subdirectories
   - **Solution**:
     ```bash
     # Create directory with proper permissions
     mkdir -p outputs
     chmod 777 outputs
     ```
   - **Alternative**: Run the application with sudo (not recommended for production):
     ```bash
     sudo python experiment.py
     ```
   - The application identifies the issue and provides specific fix instructions

2. **"Directory exists but is not writable"**
   - **Symptom**: Directory exists but files cannot be saved
   - **Cause**: Directory lacks write permissions
   - **Solution**: Fix permissions for the directory:
     ```bash
     chmod 777 outputs
     ```

3. **"At least one action phase is required"**
   - Ensure at least one GPIO action phase is configured
   - The first phase cannot be deleted

4. **"Phase X has invalid time"**
   - Ensure all phase time entries contain valid numbers
   - Time values must be non-negative
   - Supports decimal values (e.g., 30.5)

2. **"Homing failed"**
   - Check printer connection
   - Verify serial port is accessible
   - Check printer is powered on

3. **"Movement failed"**
   - Verify well positions are within printer bounds
   - Check for mechanical obstructions
   - Verify motion configuration is valid

4. **Low FPS during recording**
   - Reduce resolution
   - Lower FPS setting
   - Check SD card write speed
   - Ensure preview is disabled during recording

5. **Files not saving**
   - **Save folder permissions**: Check that `outputs/` is writable
     - The application automatically creates the directory structure if it doesn't exist
     - If creation fails, check error message for specific issue
     - Fix with: `mkdir -p outputs && chmod 777 outputs`
   - Verify disk space availability
   - Check filename scheme is valid

6. **"No calibration loaded" error**
   - Load a calibration from the dropdown before starting experiment
   - Create calibration in calibrate.py if none exist
   - Check that calibration file exists in `calibrations/`

7. **"Referenced calibration file not found" (on import)**
   - Ensure the calibration file referenced in exported settings exists
   - Re-create the calibration if it was deleted
   - Check file path in exported settings JSON
