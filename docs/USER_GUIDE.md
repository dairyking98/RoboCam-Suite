## Getting Started

### First Time Setup

1. **Hardware Connection**:
   - Connect Raspberry Pi Camera to the camera port
   - Connect 3D printer via USB serial cable
   - Connect laser module to GPIO pin (default: GPIO 21)

2. **Enable Camera**:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   # Navigate to: Interface Options → Camera → Enable
   # Reboot after enabling
   ```

3. **Set Permissions**:
   ```bash
   # Add user to dialout group for serial access
   sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
   
   # Add user to gpio group for GPIO access
   sudo usermod -a -G gpio $USER
   
   # Create output directory for experiments
   mkdir -p experiments
   chmod 777 experiments
   
   # Log out and log back in for changes to take effect
   ```
   
   **Note**: The application automatically creates `experiments/` if it doesn't exist, but requires write permissions. The directory is created automatically on first use if permissions allow.

4. **Run Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## Calibration Procedure

### Manual Calibration (calibrate.py)

The calibration application allows you to manually position the camera over wells and record coordinates.

#### Starting Calibration

```bash
./start_calibrate.sh
# Or: source venv/bin/activate && python calibrate.py
# Optional: python calibrate.py --backend qtgl  # Force specific backend
# Optional: python calibrate.py --simulate_3d  # Run without 3D printer (for testing)
# Optional: python calibrate.py --simulate_cam  # Run without camera (for testing)
```

#### Using the Calibration Interface

The calibration application opens two windows:

1. **Camera Preview Window**: 
   - Native hardware-accelerated preview (separate window)
   - High-performance display using DRM or QTGL backend
   - Automatically selected based on your system
   - Provides smooth, low-latency preview

2. **Controls Window**:
   - **Position Display**: Current X, Y, Z coordinates
   - **FPS Display**: Real-time preview frames per second
   - **Step Size Selection**: 0.1 mm, 1.0 mm, 10.0 mm, or custom value (default: 9.0 mm)
   - **Movement Controls**:
     - **Y+**: Move forward (positive Y)
     - **Y-**: Move backward (negative Y)
     - **X-**: Move left (negative X)
     - **X+**: Move right (positive X)
     - **Z-**: Move down (negative Z)
     - **Z+**: Move up (positive Z)
   - **Go to Coordinate**: Direct coordinate entry and movement
     - **X, Y, Z Entry Fields**: Enter target coordinates
     - **Go Button**: Move to specified coordinates
     - Only axes with values entered will move (blank entries are ignored)
   - **Home Button**: Returns printer to home position (0, 0, 0)
   - **Window Behavior**: Window automatically sizes to fit all content and maintains size when adjusting parameters

#### Preview Backend Options

You can specify the preview backend when starting calibrate.py:

- `--backend auto` (default): Automatically selects the best backend
  - Uses QTGL for desktop sessions (X11/Wayland)
  - Uses DRM for console/headless mode
- `--backend qtgl`: Force QTGL backend (for desktop sessions)
- `--backend drm`: Force DRM backend (for console)
- `--backend null`: Headless mode (no preview window, useful for remote operation)

#### Simulation Mode

You can run calibrate.py in simulation mode to test without 3D printer hardware:

- `--simulate_3d`: Run without 3D printer connection
  - Camera and preview work normally
  - Movements are simulated (position tracking updates, but no actual movement)
  - Window title shows "[3D PRINTER SIM]"
  
- `--simulate_cam`: Run without camera connection
  - Camera operations are skipped
  - Window title shows "[CAMERA SIM]"
  
- Both flags can be used together: `--simulate_3d --simulate_cam`
  - Useful for testing imaging workflows and calibration procedures without hardware

#### Calibration Workflow

1. **Home the Printer**: Click "Home" to return to origin
2. **Navigate to First Well**: Use movement controls to position camera over a well
3. **Fine-Tune Position**: Use 0.1 mm step size for precise alignment
4. **Record Position**: Note the X, Y, Z coordinates from the position display
5. **Repeat**: Navigate to additional wells and record their positions

#### Tips for Accurate Calibration

- Use the camera preview to visually align with well centers
- Start with larger step sizes (10 mm) for rough positioning
- Switch to smaller step sizes (0.1 mm) for fine adjustments
- **Use "Go to Coordinate"** to quickly return to previously recorded positions
  - Enter known coordinates in X, Y, Z fields
  - Leave fields blank for axes you don't want to move
  - Click "Go" to move directly to that position
- Record coordinates immediately after positioning to avoid drift
- Consider using the 4-corner calibration method for better accuracy

## 4-Corner Path Calibration

The 4-corner calibration method accounts for slight angles and misalignment in well plate positioning by recording four corner positions and interpolating all well positions.

### When to Use 4-Corner Calibration

- Well plate is not perfectly aligned with printer axes
- You need to calibrate many wells at once
- You want to account for slight rotation or skew
- You're setting up a new well plate configuration

### 4-Corner Calibration Procedure

1. **Start Calibration Application**:
   ```bash
   ./start_calibrate.sh
   ```

2. **Enter Grid Dimensions**:
   - In the "4-Corner Calibration" section, enter:
     - **X Quantity**: Number of wells horizontally (e.g., 8)
     - **Y Quantity**: Number of wells vertically (e.g., 6)
   - Preview will show total number of wells

3. **Navigate to Upper-Left Corner**:
   - Use movement controls to position camera over the upper-left well
   - Fine-tune position using 0.1 mm steps
   - Click "Set Upper-Left" button when aligned
   - Coordinates will be displayed and status indicator turns green (✓)

4. **Navigate to Lower-Left Corner**:
   - Move to the lower-left well
   - Align and click "Set Lower-Left" button
   - Coordinates will be recorded

5. **Navigate to Upper-Right Corner**:
   - Move to the upper-right well
   - Align and click "Set Upper-Right" button
   - Coordinates will be recorded

6. **Navigate to Lower-Right Corner**:
   - Move to the lower-right well
   - Align and click "Set Lower-Right" button
   - Coordinates will be recorded

7. **Verify Interpolation**:
   - Once all 4 corners are set, positions are automatically interpolated
   - Preview will show: "✓ Interpolated X wells. Labels: A1, A2, A3..."
   - Labels are auto-generated in format: A1, A2, ..., A8, B1, B2, ..., etc.

8. **Save Calibration**:
   - Enter a calibration name (e.g., "well_plate_8x6")
   - Click "Save Calibration" button
   - Calibration is saved to `calibrations/{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}_{name}.json` (automatically prefixed with date and time, e.g., `20241215_143022_well_plate_8x6.json`)
   - Status will confirm successful save with full filename
   - The date/time prefix (format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS) helps track when calibrations were created and allows multiple versions with the same name

9. **Use in Experiment**:
   - Calibration is now available in experiment.py
   - Load it from the calibration dropdown
   - Click "Select Cells" button to open well selection window

### Understanding 4-Corner Interpolation

The system uses bilinear interpolation to calculate all well positions from the four corners:

- **Upper-Left (UL)**: Top-left corner well
- **Lower-Left (LL)**: Bottom-left corner well
- **Upper-Right (UR)**: Top-right corner well
- **Lower-Right (LR)**: Bottom-right corner well

**How It Works**:
The bilinear interpolation method works in three steps:
1. For each horizontal position in the grid, interpolates along the top edge (UL → UR)
2. For the same horizontal position, interpolates along the bottom edge (LL → LR)
3. Interpolates vertically between the top and bottom points to get the final well position

This approach properly accounts for:
- Linear spacing between wells
- Rotation of the well plate (correctly handles angled alignment)
- Non-perpendicular alignment (handles skew/distortion)
- Z-axis variations across the plate

By considering both horizontal and vertical components together (rather than independently), the interpolation ensures accurate well positioning even when the plate is rotated or misaligned with the printer axes. This means wells will be correctly aligned when moving from top-left to top-right, and throughout the entire grid.

## Preview Alignment Check

The preview application (`preview.py`) allows you to sequentially navigate through well positions to verify alignment before running experiments. This is especially useful after calibration or when loading a saved experiment configuration.

### Starting Preview

```bash
./start_preview.sh
# Or manually:
source venv/bin/activate
python preview.py
# Or: python preview.py --backend auto
# Or: python preview.py --simulate_3d  # Run without 3D printer (for testing)
# Or: python preview.py --simulate_cam  # Run without camera (no preview window)
```

### Preview Interface

The preview application opens two windows:

1. **Camera Preview Window**: 
   - Native hardware-accelerated preview (separate window)
   - High-performance display using DRM or QTGL backend
   - Same preview system as calibrate.py

2. **Controls Window**:
   - **Source Selection**: Choose to load from "Calibration File" or "Experiment Save File" (radio buttons)
   - **File Dropdown**: Select file from dropdown menu (automatically populated based on source type)
   - **Load Button**: Loads the selected file
   - **Well Display**: Two view modes available via dropdown:
     - **Well List View**: Scrollable listbox showing all loaded wells (default)
     - **Graphical View**: Visual grid of wells arranged in x×y layout, clickable buttons
       - When loaded from experiment: irrelevant wells are grayed out
       - Window automatically resizes to fit the grid
   - **Navigation Controls**:
     - **Home Printer**: Home the printer (optional - navigation works from current position)
     - **Previous**: Move to previous well in sequence
     - **Next**: Move to next well in sequence
     - **Go to Selected**: Move to the currently selected well
   - **Status Display**: Shows current well, position, and operation status
   - **Position Display**: Current X, Y, Z coordinates
   - **FPS Display**: Real-time preview frames per second

### Loading Wells

#### From Calibration File

1. Select "Calibration File" radio button
2. Select a calibration JSON file from the dropdown menu (automatically shows files from `calibrations/` directory)
3. Click "Load" button
4. All wells from the calibration will be loaded

#### From Experiment Save File

1. Select "Experiment Save File" radio button
2. Select an exported experiment settings JSON file from the dropdown menu (automatically shows files from `experiments/` directory)
3. Click "Load" button
4. The application will:
   - Load the referenced calibration file
   - Filter to only the wells that were checked in the experiment
   - Display only those selected wells in the list

### Preview Workflow

1. **Load Wells**:
   - Choose source type (calibration or experiment file) using radio buttons
   - Select a file from the dropdown menu (automatically updates based on source type)
   - Click "Load" button
   - Status will show number of wells loaded

2. **Home Printer** (Optional):
   - Click "Home Printer" button if you want to start from origin
   - Current coordinates are shown on startup
   - Navigation works from current position - homing is not required

3. **Navigate Through Wells**:
   - **Click on a well** in the list to select it
   - **Use "Go to Selected"** to move to that well position
   - **Use "Next"** to move to the next well sequentially
   - **Use "Previous"** to move to the previous well sequentially
   - Navigation wraps around (Next from last goes to first, Previous from first goes to last)

4. **Verify Alignment**:
   - Use camera preview to visually check alignment at each position
   - Check that camera is centered over each well
   - Verify focus is correct
   - Note any wells that need adjustment

5. **Make Adjustments** (if needed):
   - If alignment is off, note which wells need adjustment
   - Return to calibrate.py to fine-tune positions
   - Re-save calibration if needed
   - Re-load in preview.py to verify

### Tips for Preview

- **Homing is optional**: Navigation works from current position, just like calibrate.py
- **Use sequential navigation**: The "Next" and "Previous" buttons make it easy to go through all wells in order
- **Check critical wells**: Focus on wells that are critical for your experiment
- **Verify before experiment**: Use preview to catch alignment issues before running a long experiment
- **Compare with calibration**: If preview shows misalignment, the calibration may need adjustment
- **Window Behavior**: Window maintains size when switching between list and graphical views (if both fit). Window automatically resizes only if content would be cut off. You can manually resize the window as needed.

### When to Use Preview

- **After calibration**: Verify that interpolated positions are accurate
- **Before experiments**: Check alignment before running automated experiments
- **After loading experiment settings**: Verify that selected wells are correctly positioned
- **After hardware changes**: If you've moved the well plate or adjusted the setup

### Integration with Workflow

The preview tool fits into the overall workflow:

1. **Calibrate** (calibrate.py) → Create calibration with well positions
2. **Preview** (preview.py) → Verify alignment of all wells or selected wells
3. **Experiment** (experiment.py) → Run automated experiment with verified positions

## Experiment Setup

### Starting the Experiment Application

```bash
./start_experiment.sh
# Or: source venv/bin/activate && python experiment.py
# Or: python experiment.py --simulate_3d  # Run without 3D printer (for testing)

   - Each checkbox represents a well (labeled A1, A2, B1, etc.)
   - All wells are checked by default
   - Uncheck wells you want to exclude from the experiment
   - Use "Check All" or "Uncheck All" buttons (above the grid) for quick selection
   - **Keyboard Shortcuts** (Smart Fill/Unfill Logic):
     - **Shift+Click**: Smart fill/unfill all wells in the same row
       - If the clicked checkbox is checked and the row is all checked: unfills (unchecks all) in the row
       - If the clicked checkbox is checked and the row is not all checked: fills (checks all) in the row
       - If the clicked checkbox is unchecked and the row is all unchecked: fills (checks all) in the row
       - If the clicked checkbox is unchecked and the row has some checked: unfills (unchecks all) in the row
     - **Ctrl+Click**: Smart fill/unfill all wells in the same column
       - If the clicked checkbox is checked and the column is all checked: unfills (unchecks all) in the column
       - If the clicked checkbox is checked and the column is not all checked: fills (checks all) in the column
       - If the clicked checkbox is unchecked and the column is all unchecked: fills (checks all) in the column
       - If the clicked checkbox is unchecked and the column has some checked: unfills (unchecks all) in the column
   - Instructions are displayed next to the grid explaining all interaction methods
   - Run button will be disabled if no wells are selected

4. **Configure Timing**:
   - **Times**: Enter three values (OFF, ON, OFF in seconds)
     - Example: `30, 0, 0` means 30s OFF, 0s ON, 0s OFF
     - Example: `10, 20, 10` means 10s OFF, 20s ON, 10s OFF

     - `snake →↙`: Zig-zag pattern (alternates row direction)
     - `raster →↓`: Rectilinear pattern (consistent direction, default)
   - **Experiment Name**: Name identifier for the experiment (default: "exp")
     - Used in generated filenames: `{date}_{time}_{experiment_name}_{y}{x}.{ext}`
     - Example: `20241215_143022_exp_B2.h264`
   - **Save Folder**: Files are automatically saved to `outputs/YYYYMMDD_{experiment_name}/` (not configurable via GUI)
     - Each experiment run gets its own subfolder with date prefix
     - Format: `outputs/YYYYMMDD_{experiment_name}/` where YYYYMMDD is the date when experiment starts
     - Example: experiment name "exp" run on Dec 15, 2024 saves to `outputs/20241215_exp/`

9. **Status and Recording Indicator**:
   - **Status Display**: Shows current experiment progress, well being processed, and any errors

    - **Load**: Select from "Experiment Settings" dropdown to load saved configuration (similar to calibration dropdown)
      - Click "Refresh" to update the list of available settings
      - Calibration file must exist for load to succeed
      - If calibration is missing, load will fail with error message
      - All settings including checkbox states will be restored

12. **Click "Run"** to start the experiment

### Filename Format

Files are automatically named using the format: `{date}_{time}_{experiment_name}_{y}{x}.{ext}`

**Examples**:
- Experiment name "exp", well B2, captured at 14:30:22 on December 15th, 2024 → `20241215_143022_exp_B2.h264`
- Experiment name "test1", well A5, captured at 09:15:30 on December 3rd, 2024 → `20241203_091530_test1_A5.mjpeg`

**Components**:
- `{date}`: Date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., "20241215", "20241203")
- `{time}`: Time in HHMMSS format (e.g., "143022", "091530")
- `{experiment_name}`: Value from "Experiment Name" field (default: "exp")
- `{y}`: Row letter (A, B, C, etc.)
- `{x}`: Column number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `{ext}`: File extension based on export type (`.h264`, `.mjpeg`, `.jpeg`)

## Motion Configuration

Motion configuration files control the feedrate (speed) and acceleration for different movement phases.

### Understanding Motion Settings

- **Preliminary Feedrate/Acceleration**: Used for:
  - Homing operation
  - Initial positioning moves
  - Moving to first well
  
- **Between-Wells Feedrate/Acceleration**: Used for:
  - All movements between wells during experiment
  - Well-to-well transitions

### Selecting a Motion Profile

1. In the experiment window, find the "Motion Profile" dropdown
2. Select from available profiles:
   - **default**: Balanced speed and precision for general use
   - **precise**: Lower speed and acceleration for maximum precision
   - **fast**: Maximum speed for rapid well-to-well movements

The selected profile's settings are displayed below the dropdown, showing:
- Preliminary feedrate and acceleration (for homing and initial moves)
- Between-wells feedrate and acceleration (for well-to-well movements)

### Creating Custom Motion Profile

1. Open `config/motion_config.json` in a text editor

2. Add a new profile entry with your preferred values:
   ```json
   {
     "default": { ... },
     "precise": { ... },
     "fast": { ... },
     "my_custom_profile": {
       "name": "My Custom Profile",
       "description": "Custom settings for my experiments",
       "preliminary": {
         "feedrate": 2000,
         "acceleration": 1000
       },
       "between_wells": {
         "feedrate": 1500,
         "acceleration": 800
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save the file
4. Restart experiment.py to see the new profile in the dropdown

### Motion Configuration Guidelines

- **High Feedrate/Acceleration**: Faster experiments, but may cause vibration
- **Low Feedrate/Acceleration**: Slower but more precise, reduces vibration
- **Preliminary settings**: Can be higher since initial moves don't need precision
- **Between-wells settings**: Should match your precision requirements

## Running Experiments

### Starting an Experiment

1. **Prepare**:
   - Ensure well plate is properly positioned
   - Verify camera is focused
   - Check laser connection
   - Confirm `outputs/` has sufficient space
   - Verify directory permissions (application will create directories automatically, but needs write permissions)

2. **Configure**: Complete experiment setup (see Experiment Setup section)

3. **Start**:
   - Click "Run" button in experiment window
   - Experiment will:
     - Home the printer (or simulate homing in 3D printer simulation mode)
     - Move to each well in sequence (or simulate movement in 3D printer simulation mode)
     - Record video/still at each well
     - Control laser according to timing settings

**Note**: You can test experiments without hardware by running with simulation flags:
```bash
python experiment.py --simulate_3d  # Simulate 3D printer only
python experiment.py --simulate_cam  # Simulate camera only
python experiment.py --simulate_3d --simulate_cam  # Simulate both
```
In 3D printer simulation mode, all movements are simulated but camera and imaging features work normally. In camera simulation mode, capture operations are skipped. The window title shows "[3D PRINTER SIM]" and/or "[CAMERA SIM]" when active.

4. **Monitor**:
   - Watch status messages in the GUI
   - Monitor elapsed time and remaining time
   - Check position updates

### During Experiment

- **Pause**: Click "Pause" to temporarily pause (movement and recording stop)
- **Resume**: Click "Pause" again to resume
- **Stop**: Click "Stop" to abort experiment
  - Laser will turn off
  - Recording will stop
  - Printer will remain at current position

### After Experiment

1. **Check Output Files**:
   - Navigate to `outputs/YYYYMMDD_{experiment_name}/` (where YYYYMMDD is the date and {experiment_name} is your experiment name)
   - Example: `outputs/20241215_exp/` for experiment "exp" run on Dec 15, 2024
   - Verify all files were created
   - Check file sizes (should be non-zero)

2. **Review CSV File**:
   - Open the CSV file (format: `{date}_{time}_{exp}_points.csv`) in `outputs/YYYYMMDD_{experiment_name}/`
   - Verify all wells were visited
   - Check coordinates match expectations

3. **Check FPS Metadata Files** (for video recordings):
   - Each video recording has a corresponding metadata file: `{video_filename}_metadata.json`
   - Example: `20241215_143022_exp_B2.h264` → `20241215_143022_exp_B2_metadata.json`
   - Contains target FPS, actual FPS, resolution, duration, actual duration, format, timestamp, and well label
   - **Target FPS**: The FPS value set in the GUI (desired frame rate)
   - **Actual FPS**: The actual frame rate achieved during recording (calculated from actual duration)
   - **Critical for accurate playback**, especially for MJPEG files
   - For MJPEG playback, use the actual FPS value from the metadata file:
     - VLC: `vlc --demux=mjpeg --mjpeg-fps=<actual_fps_from_metadata> video.mjpeg`
   - H264 videos have actual FPS embedded, but metadata file provides additional information
   - If the camera cannot achieve the target FPS, the actual FPS will be recorded in the metadata

4. **Review Logs**:
   - Check log file in `logs/` directory
   - Look for any errors or warnings
   - Check for FPS warnings - system logs actual vs expected duration to detect FPS issues

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

- **Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'libcamera'` when running scripts
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensure `python3-libcamera` is installed: `sudo apt-get install -y python3-libcamera`
  - The virtual environment must be created with `--system-site-packages` to access system packages
  - Use the fix script: `./fix_dependencies.sh` to automatically fix this
  - Or recreate the venv: `rm -rf venv && python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv`

- **Problem**: `setup.sh` fails with "Failed to build 'python-prctl'" or missing headers
- **Solution**:
  - Install system dependencies: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libcap-dev python3-dev build-essential`
  - The setup script should do this automatically, but if it fails, install manually
  - Use the fix script: `./fix_dependencies.sh`

- **Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'picamera2'` in virtual environment
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure virtual environment is activated: `source venv/bin/activate`
  - Reinstall packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Verify installation: `pip list | grep picamera2`

### Printer Not Moving

- **Check serial connection**: Ensure USB cable is connected
- **Verify baudrate**: Default is 115200, check printer settings
- **Check permissions**: User must be in `dialout` group
- **Test connection**: Try homing manually in calibrate.py

### Camera Not Working

- **Enable camera**: Run `sudo raspi-config` → Interface Options → Camera
- **Check connection**: Verify camera ribbon cable is secure
- **Reboot**: Sometimes required after enabling camera
- **Check permissions**: Ensure camera is accessible

### Laser Not Turning On

- **Check GPIO pin**: Default is GPIO 21, verify connection
- **Check permissions**: User must be in `gpio` group
- **Test manually**: Try manual control in calibrate.py
- **Verify wiring**: Check laser module connections

### Low FPS During Recording

**Understanding Target vs Actual FPS**:
- The GUI displays "TARGET FPS" - this is the desired frame rate you set
- The system calculates and records the actual FPS achieved during recording
- If the camera cannot achieve the target FPS, the actual FPS will be saved in the metadata JSON file
- Always use `actual_fps` from the metadata JSON for accurate playback and analysis

**Solutions**:
- **Reduce recording resolution**: Lower resolution = higher FPS
- **Lower TARGET FPS setting**: If camera cannot achieve target, reduce the target FPS value
- **Check SD card write speed**: Slow storage can limit FPS
- **Ensure preview is disabled during recording**: Preview is automatically disabled during recording
- **Check application logs**: System logs actual vs expected duration and calculates actual FPS
- **Reduce recording resolution**: Lower resolution = higher FPS
- **Check storage speed**: Ensure save location is fast (not network drive)

### Experiment Stops Unexpectedly

- **Check log file**: Look for error messages
- **Verify coordinates**: Ensure all coordinates are within printer limits
- **Check serial connection**: Printer may have disconnected
- **Review timing**: Very short times may cause issues

### Files Not Saving

- **Check folder permissions**: Ensure `outputs/` is writable
  - The application automatically creates the directory structure if it doesn't exist
  - If you see "Permission denied" errors, the application will identify the issue
  - To fix permissions, run:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p outputs
    chmod 777 outputs
    ```
  - **Verify disk space**: Check available space with `df -h`
  - **Check experiment name**: Invalid characters in experiment name may cause filename issues
  - **Review log file**: Look for file write errors
  - **Error messages**: The application provides specific error messages identifying:
  - Whether the directory exists but is not writable
  - Exact commands to fix the issue

## Best Practices

1. **Calibration**:
   - Calibrate before each experiment session
   - Use 4-corner calibration for best accuracy (now implemented)
   - Save calibrations with descriptive names
   - Calibrations are reusable across experiments
   - Export experiment settings to preserve calibration references

2. **Experiment Setup**:
   - Always load a calibration before running experiment
   - Test with a single well first (uncheck all others)
   - Verify timing settings are correct
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Export experiment settings for reproducibility

3. **Motion Settings**:
   - Start with default motion configuration
   - Adjust based on your precision needs
   - Higher speeds may cause vibration

4. **File Management**:
   - Use descriptive experiment names
   - Organize experiments in dated folders
   - Keep CSV files with video files for reference

5. **Safety**:
   - Always stop experiment if something looks wrong
   - Monitor first few wells closely
   - Keep emergency stop accessible
   - Verify laser power settings

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Well Patterns

You can create custom well patterns by:
1. Using 4-corner calibration and selecting specific wells via checkboxes
2. Editing the CSV file after export (for reference only - coordinates come from calibration)
3. Creating multiple calibrations for different well plate configurations

### Batch Experiments

To run multiple experiments:
1. Save different experiment configurations
2. Load configuration before each run
3. Use different experiment names to distinguish experiments
4. All files are saved to `outputs/YYYYMMDD_{experiment_name}/` (where YYYYMMDD is the date when experiment runs)

### Integration with Analysis Tools

The CSV output (format: `{date}_{time}_{exp}_points.csv`, located in `outputs/YYYYMMDD_{experiment_name}/`) can be imported into:
- Excel/Google Sheets for basic analysis
- Python pandas for data analysis
- ImageJ/Fiji for image analysis workflows
- Custom analysis scripts
